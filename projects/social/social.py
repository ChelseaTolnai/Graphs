"""
Q:  To create 100 users with an average of 10 friends each, how many times would you need to call addFriendship()? Why?
A:  500. => The function is ran for every item in an array from index 0 to the number of connection you want to make.
    The number of connections is determined by numUsers * avgFriendships // 2 ==> (100 * 10)//2 ==> 1000//2 ==> 500

Q:  If you create 1000 users with an average of 5 random friends each, what percentage of other users will be in a particular user's extended social network? 
    What is the average degree of separation between a user and those in his/her extended network?
A:  After running several times, the percentage comes out to average a little over 99% of other users being in the social network 
    with an average of about 5 degrees of seperation.


Stretch Goal
Q:  You might have found the results from question #2 above to be surprising. 
    Would you expect results like this in real life? 
    If not, what are some ways you could improve your friendship distribution model for more realistic results?
A:  I would not expect in real life for a user to be connected with 99% of all other users and by only 5 degrees.
    One way to improve this model is to possibly not do a full shuffle of all the possible friendships.
    That way some of the friends could be grouped together a little more realistically like real groups of friends.
    You could also maybe write a shuffle algorithm that is weighted to try to pick a certain number or two 
    more frequently than others to try to recreate a grouping of friends.

Q:  If you followed the hints for part 1, your populateGraph() will run in O(n^2) time. 
    Refactor your code to run in O(n) time. 
    Are there any tradeoffs that come with this implementation?
A:  Able to get it down to O(n) with a side effect that it can generate random invalid connections like trying to
    befriend yourself or a friend a user you are already connected with. Cannot avoid this case unless creating a sub
    function within the for loop which at worst would be O(n^2) but it reality would only run that second O(n) function
    a few times not every time.
